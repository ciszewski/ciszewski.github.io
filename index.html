								<strong>Top ten Basketball players of all time. </strong> Number 1 MICHAEL JORDAN ,"MJ" accomplished everything possible in the game, piling up on the stats and awards. On the game's biggest stage—the NBA Finals—Jordan went a perfect 6-for-6, also sweeping Finals MVP in his appearances.

The Chicago Bulls legend dominated both sides of the ball, amassing 11 All-NBA selections, nine All-Defensive First team selections and 10 scoring titles.

There is plenty of evidence to support Michael Jordan's GOAT status, however, his greatest feat of all might have come before he even won an NBA title. In the 1988 season, he won MVP, Defensive Player of the Year and the NBA's scoring title. His insane '88 season went like this: 35 points on 53% shooting, 5.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 3.2 steals, 1.6 blocks.

								<p>Number 2 KAREEM ADUL-JABBAR, Before Duncan, there was Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, in terms of consistency. His ability to maintain such averages while competing for 20 seasons is simply a testament to his greatness.

Here's a rundown of Kareem's biggest feats: all-time leading scorer in NBA history, most regular season MVP awards (six), 15 All-NBA selections, 11 All-Defense selections, 19 All-Star appearances.</p>  <img src="http://iriefm.net/wp-content/uploads/Jabar.jpg"width="400">
								<strong>
							
                            <p>Number 3 Bill Russell, the greatest defender in the game's history led the Boston Celtics to a record 11 NBA Championships.

Bill Russell is an interesting case, as his offensive stats don't jump out at you, but his impact went far beyond numbers. Russell could flat-out dominate the game defensively. Still, his career averages are nothing to sniff at, and if blocks and Finals MVPs were counted/awarded throughout his career, he would've won plenty of those.

Russell is the greatest winner in all of sports. His 11-championship count may be the safest record in the NBA game.</p>
<p>
                            <img src="http://onemanfastbreak.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Bill-Russell.jpg">
                            <p>Number 4 Hakeem Olajuwon, Hakeem Olajuwon's dominance on the inside was a thing of beauty. He abused many a defender with his trademark "Dream Shake" move. Olajuwon's game is so renowned that superstars like Kobe Bryant, LeBron James and Dwight Howard have looked to improve their game under his tutelage.

Offense aside, Olajuwon was one of the game's greatest defenders, partly evidenced by his 3.3 block-per-game average.

"The Dream" led a marginally-talented Houston Rockets team to back-to-back NBA Championships, winning two Finals MVPs and one regular season MVP. He is the only player in NBA history to win regular season MVP, Finals MVP and Defensive Player of the Year in the same season (1994).</p> <p> <img src="http://photocdn.sohu.com/20110827/Img317520408.jpg">

                        								 <p>Number 5 Erwin Johnson known as Magic Johnson, Magic Johnson began his career with greatness and never looked back. He won Finals MVP as a rookie when he famously started center in place of the injured Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in Game 6 of the 1980 NBA Finals. The Finals were like a second home to Magic and the Showtime Los Angeles Lakers, as they made nine trips during his illustrious career.

The 6'9" point guard used his large frame to shred defenses with precision. Magic's 12.3 assists ranks first all-time in the playoffs. In his 14-year career, he amassed 10 All-NBA selections.</p>
<p> <img src="http://www.aneki.com/images/greatest_basketball_players/act_magic_johnson.jpg">
	<P> Number 6 Larry Bird,Derrick Rose gave a rather fitting assessment of Larry Bird in an interview with Rappler Sports recently. Bird was never the most athletic player on the court, but he was always dominant. Whatever he lacked in athleticism, he made up for with his basketball IQ, great skills—including that deadly jump shot—and fierce competitiveness. 

Bird led the Boston Celtics to three NBA Championships, compiling three regular season MVPs and 2 Finals MVPs along the way. "Larry Legend" was selected to 10 All-NBA and three All-Defense Teams in his 13-year career.</p> <p> <img src="http://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_root/slides/photos/000/990/983/larry-bird_display_image_display_image.jpg?1307283538"> </p>
<p>Number 7 Wilt Chamberlian nick name is Wilt the Stilt,Wilt Chamberlain is the reason  Shaq was "possibly" the most dominant player of all time. Chamberlain's dominance is widely acknowledged, and as time passes he seems more and more like a mythical figure. In the 1961-62 regular season, he averaged 50.4 points and 25.7 rebounds. Simply unreal.

Had Wilt accomplished more in the postseason, he would be closer to No. 1. It seems crazy to expect more from a player who averaged 22 and 25, but that's how it goes when you're the most dominant.</p>
